abstract: 'Since the expansion of the Neolithic across the Mediterranean, with the arrival and
consolidation of village life and agriculture, long-distance exchange experiences
unusual growth, and exotic items become an important means of displaying new roles
and social differences within and between communities. The use and association
of exotic items with specific individuals increase as social complexity grows and it
becomes more necessary to enhance social differences and exhibit the status of the
bearer. The study of the geographical origin and the Spatio-temporal distribution
patterns of exotic raw materials and their products are trending topics in European
archaeological research since they are considered key to understanding social
146interaction and the mobility patterns of individuals and goods at different scales.
Variscite-like minerals are some of the most used materials for the elaboration of body
adornments in prehistory that have both, an important weight in the archaeological
record and a relevant research tradition in the Iberian Peninsula context. Thanks to the
development of novel chemical analytical techniques, which are both portable and
non-destructive, in the last ten years it has been possible to record data of thousands
of items of personal adornment made out of different minerals from more than
900 archaeological sites on the Iberian Peninsula through different projects, which
represents a first-rate experimental data set for the study of these subjects. Despite
the existence of such relevant data sets, to date, there are both methodological and
theoretical challenges in extracting knowledge from this type of resource due to the
lack of comprehensive studies with a data-driven approach. It is still necessary to
make exhaustive inventories of Iberian sources, mineralogical characterisation of
items, and systematisation of scattered and unpublished data among other urgent
tasks that will improve or reconsider provenance models used to explain the socio-
economic dynamics in late prehistory. Through the use of different techniques of
Computational archaeology such as Data mining and Machine Learning, this project
aims to explore a data-driven approach to solve some of the main methodological
challenges in the study of the socio-economic complexity in the late prehistory of the
Iberian Peninsula and develop an Open Access approach for the publication of results
by the necessity of digitalization of humanities.'
