abstract: The discovery of a set of beads, comprising both Sicilian amber and resin-coated
  beads in the Middle Bronze Age burial site of Cova del Gegant (Sitges, Barcelona,
  Spain), has sparked inquiries into whether the coating was intended for imitation
  or counterfeiting of amber. We assert that human-made materials, such as bead coatings,
  are intentionally conceived, designed, and crafted to fulfill specific functions.
  Thus, for an object to effectively fulfill its intended purpose, it must meet particular
  performance criteria influenced by situational factors. This paper aims to construct
  an empirically grounded narrative elucidating the development and function of resin-coated
  bead technology. Our methodology includes a comprehensive quantitative analysis
  of the coating and beads, an exploration of the interplay between technical choices
  and situational factors, and an investigation into whether the simulation of sensory
  performance characteristics played a pivotal role in the concept and design of resin-coated
  beads. Additionally, we synthesize data to unveil broader patterns related to the
  crafting and utilization of resin-coated and amber beads across time and space.
  We have documented resin-coated beads in the Iberian Peninsula from the Neolithic
  period (5th to 3rd millennia BCE) until at least the Middle Bronze Age (first half
  of the 2nd millennium BCE), where they coexisted with amber beads. Analysis employing
  ATR-FTIR and $μ$-CT imaging has revealed a composite coating comprising pine resin,
  beeswax, and carotene, adhered to shell beads with bone glue. This composite material
  represents the earliest known development in human history, unique to the Iberian
  Peninsula and without parallel in Prehistoric Europe. Our examination of the performance
  characteristics and functional roles of resin-coated beads suggests their potential
  as substitutes for amber beads, particularly in regions where amber was scarce or
  inaccessible. Despite being crafted from commonplace materials, these coated beads
  exhibit intentional design choices likely aimed at simulating the visual performance
  characteristics of amber. This deliberate effort, alongside their widespread distribution
  across time and space, indicates that composite-coated beads held symbolic and social
  significance akin to amber beads.
